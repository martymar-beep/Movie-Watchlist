## 🎬 Movie Watchlist

*A responsive movie search and watchlist app powered by the OMDb API.*

### 📍 Overview

This two-page web app allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API and add their favorites to a personalized watchlist. 
It offers a clean UI, dynamic content updates, and persistent storage using localStorage.

### 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me get more comfortable working with **asynchronous JavaScript** and using `.then()` to handle promises. 
I gained a deeper understanding of **callback functions** in event-driven code and practiced writing my own version of `.filter()` 
to understand how it works under the hood.

I also improved my skills in:
- Working with **external APIs**
- Managing data between pages
- Implementing a **clear user flow**

### 💡 What I Enjoyed

What I enjoyed most was building a "real-world" project that people would actually use. 
Although building an API that works across pages was a big challenge, seeing the final product come together was incredibly rewarding!
